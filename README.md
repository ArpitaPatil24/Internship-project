-:UI Implementation from Figma:-
Objective:
Convert the provided Figma designs into a working React application.
Ensure pixel-perfect accuracy and responsiveness across different screen sizes.
Implement all visual elements, layouts, and styles as specified in the Figma designs.
Attention to detail in typography, spacing, colors, and component reusability.

Key Achievements:
Responsiveness: The app is fully responsive and optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
Pixel-Perfect UI: The UI closely follows the Figma design, ensuring all visual elements are properly implemented.
Interactive Elements: Buttons, forms, and lists are implemented as interactive components, responding to user input as expected.
Component Breakdown
The application has been broken down into reusable React components for better maintainability and code reusability.

Key Components:
Header: Displays the app’s title and theme toggle button.
Footer: Contains navigation icons and links.
Card: Displays individual items with dynamic content.
Modal: A pop-up used for detailed views and interactions.
Theme Toggle: Allows users to switch between dark and light modes.
The components are organized to follow best practices of React, ensuring clear separation of concerns and easy maintainability.
Interaction and Functionality

Key Interactions:
User Interaction: The user can interact with different UI elements such as buttons, forms, and clickable items.
State Management: React’s useState and useEffect hooks are used to manage application state and trigger updates based on user interactions.
API Calls: Mocked API calls are implemented to demonstrate integration with third-party services.
Code Quality and Best Practices
Clean Code: All code is written in a clean, modular, and maintainable manner, following React best practices.
Error Handling: Proper error handling is in place to ensure smooth user experience and graceful failure of operations.
Commenting: The code is well-documented with comments explaining the purpose and functionality of key parts of the code.
Version Control: Git is used for version control, and the project is regularly committed and pushed to GitHub.

Features
1. Dark and Light Mode Toggle
The app features a Dark Mode and Light Mode toggle functionality.
The toggle can be activated by clicking the Moon (Dark Mode) or Sun (Light Mode) icons in the top header.
The theme is stored in localStorage, ensuring the theme preference is retained across sessions.
Dark Mode uses a dark color palette, while Light Mode has a bright theme.

2. Responsive Layout
The application is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

3. Interactive Elements
Buttons, forms, and lists interact with the user, updating the application state and triggering visual changes accordingly.

4. Mock API Integration
The application demonstrates API integration by making mock API calls using fetch or Axios, simulating third-party integrations.

Challenges Faced
Theme Toggle Implementation: Implementing the dark/light mode toggle required managing state and ensuring persistence across sessions using localStorage.
Responsiveness: Ensuring the UI components were fully responsive required careful attention to media queries and flexbox/grid layouts.
Pixel-Perfect Accuracy: Ensuring the design matched the Figma file pixel-for-pixel required meticulous attention to detail in spacing, typography, and colors.

Technology Stack
Frontend: React, React Router, CSS, HTML
State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
API Integration: Mock API using Fetch/Axios
Version Control: Git, GitHub

ThemeToggle

Theme Toggle Feature
The application includes a Dark Mode and Light Mode toggle functionality. The toggle buttons are represented by the Moon (Dark Mode) and Sun (Light Mode) icons at the top of the page. By clicking the respective icon, the theme switches, providing a dark or light interface based on user preference.
Light Mode is set as the default theme.
Dark Mode can be activated by clicking the Moon icon.
The theme preference is stored in localStorage, so it persists even when the page is reloaded.

Conclusion
This project is a React-based application designed to demonstrate the ability to implement interactive UIs, state management, and responsiveness while adhering to best practices. The task was completed by translating Figma designs into a fully functional and interactive React application, along with added features such as the Dark/Light mode toggle and mock API integrations.
